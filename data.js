The past few years have been arduous but rewarding. I have built enterprise level applications in support of one of our nation\'s largest HVAC distributors. While I still have a lot to learn, I have a lot to offer to your team and organization. When I am not working or studying I often roll around on mats practicing jiu-jitsu or pretending to be a rock star on my guitar. If you\'re reading this then I suppose you\'d like to learn about my development experience...I\'ll leave you to it!'
