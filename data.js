The past few years have been arduous but rewarding. I have proven myself in the industry and released projects that our nation\'s critical infrastructure depend on. While I still have a lot to learn, I have a lot to offer to your team and organization. When I am not working or studying I often roll around on mats practicing jiu-jitsu or pretend to be a rock star on my guitar. I enjoy challenges and live for those moments when I cross the last task off the list. If you\'re reading this then I suppose you\'d like to learn about my development experience...I\'ll leave you to it!'
